Permutations
============

This page contains the documentation for functionality in
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` for permutations.

Permutations on up to ``4294967296`` points are available in
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` using the function :py:class:`Perm`.
:py:class:`Perm` is a function that returns an instance of one of a number of
internal classes. These internal types are optimised for the number of points
in the image of the specified permutation with fewer points requiring less
space per point.  If ``libsemigroups`` has been compiled with ``HPCombi``
enabled, then the objects returned by :py:class:`Perm` use the SSE and AVX
instruction sets are used for very fast manipulation.

While :py:class:`Perm` is not a class the objects returned by
:py:class:`Perm` have identical methods, and so we document
:py:class:`Perm` as if it was a class.

.. py:class:: Perm

      Instances of this class implement permutations.

      A permutation :math:`f` is just a bijective function defined on
      the whole of :math:`\{0,1,\ldots,nâˆ’1\}` for some positive integer
      :math:`n` called the *degree* of :math:`f`. A permutation is stored
      as an array of the images :math:`\{(0)f,(1)f,\ldots,(nâˆ’1)f\}`.

      .. py:method:: __eq__(self: Perm, that: Perm) -> bool

          Equality comparison.

          Returns ``True`` if ``self`` equals ``that`` by comparing their
          image values.

          :param that: the permutation for comparison.
          :type that: Perm

          :returns: A ``bool``.

      .. py:method:: __getitem__(self: Perm, i: int) -> int

            Returns the image of ``i``.

            :param i: the value whose image is sought.
            :type i: int

            :return: An ``int``.

      .. py:method:: __lt__(self: Perm, that: Perm) -> bool

            Less than comparison.

            Returns ``True`` if the list of images of ``self`` is
            lexicographically less than the list of images of ``that``.

            :param that: the permutation for comparison.
            :type that: Perm

            :returns: A ``bool``.

      .. py:method:: __mul__(self: Perm, that: Perm) -> Perm

            Right multiply ``self`` by ``that``.

            :param that: the permutation to multiply with.
            :type that: Perm

            :returns: A :py:class:`Perm`.

      .. py:method:: degree(self: Perm) -> int

            Returns the degree.

            Returns the number of points that the permutation is defined
            on.

            :Parameters: ``None``
            :return: An ``int``.

      .. py:method:: identity(self: Perm) -> int

            Returns the identity permutation on :py:meth:`degree` points.

            :Parameters: None

            :return: A :py:class:`Perm`.

      .. py:staticmethod:: make(l: List[int]) -> Perm

            Construct and validate.

            Constructs a permutation initialized using list ``l`` as
            follows: the image of the point ``i`` under the permutation is
            ``l[i]``.

            :param l: the list of images.
            :type l: List[int]

            :return: A newly constructed permutation.
            :rtype: Perm

            :raises RuntimeError: if any value in ``l`` exceeds ``len(l)``.

      .. py:staticmethod:: make_identity(M: int) -> Perm

            Returns the identity permutation on the given number of
            points.

            :Parameters: **M** (int) - the degree.

            :Returns: A value of type :py:class:`Perm`.

      .. py:method:: product_inplace(self: Perm, x: Perm, y: Perm) -> None

            Multiply two permutations and store the product in ``self``.

            :param x: a permutation.
            :type x: Perm
            :param y: a permutation.
            :type y: Perm

            :return: (None)

      .. py:method:: rank(self: Perm) -> int

            Returns the number of distinct image values.

            The rank of a permutation is the number of its
            distinct image values.

            :Parameters: None
            :return: An ``int``.

      .. py:method:: images(self: Perm) -> Iterator

            Returns an iterator pointing at the first image value.

            :Parameters: None
            :return: An iterator.
      .. py:method:: inverse(self: Perm) -> Perm

            Returns the inverse.

            :Parameters: None
            :Returns: A :py:class:`Perm`.
